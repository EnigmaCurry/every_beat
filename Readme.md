# Every beat

Drawing inspiration from Autechre who once made a track of entirely
non-repeating beats, I'm attempting to generate every possible 1 bar drum
machine pattern. I'm assuming a 16 step sequencer and a restricted set of drums.
This is actually a simple exercise in data mapping; each step is either on or
off so binary numbers can be mapped directly to patterns though I intend to
re-order the mapping to produce more common beats first.
